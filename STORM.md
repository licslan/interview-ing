     Why use Apache Storm?
     Apache Storm is a free and open source distributed realtime computation system. Apache Storm makes 
     it easy to reliably process unbounded streams of data, doing for realtime processing what Hadoop 
     did for batch processing. Apache Storm is simple, can be used with any programming language, and 
     is a lot of fun to use!
     
     Apache Storm has many use cases: realtime analytics, online machine learning, continuous computation, 
     distributed RPC, ETL, and more. Apache Storm is fast: a benchmark clocked it at over a million 
     tuples processed per second per node. It is scalable, fault-tolerant, guarantees your data will be 
     processed, and is easy to set up and operate.
     
     Apache Storm integrates with the queueing and database technologies you already use. An Apache Storm 
     topology consumes streams of data and processes those streams in arbitrarily complex ways, 
     repartitioning the streams between each stage of the computation however needed. Read more in the 
     tutorial.
     Storm 是一个免费并开源的分布式实时计算系统。利用 Storm 可以很容易做到可靠地处理无限的
     数据流，像 Hadoop 批量处理大数据一样，Storm 可以实时处理数据
